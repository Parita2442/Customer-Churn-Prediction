# Customer Churn Prediction Model for Telecommunications Company

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn within a telecommunications company. Anticipating customer churn can significantly benefit the company by reducing the costs associated with customer acquisition.

## Methodology
We employed supervised machine learning techniques to build models capable of classifying customers as potential churners or non-churners based on their historical usage patterns and service plan features. Our analysis included popular algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and XGBoost.

## Results
After thorough evaluation, the Decision Tree model emerged as the top performer, achieving a balanced accuracy of 97.86%. Although the ensemble method with XGBoost slightly outperformed it with a balanced accuracy of 98.06%, we opted for the Decision Tree due to its favorable balance between performance and computational efficiency.

## Implementation
The chosen Decision Tree model serves as a valuable tool for the company, enabling proactive identification of customers at risk of churn. This allows timely implementation of retention strategies to mitigate churn rates effectively.
